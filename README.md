This app is developed as a Final Project assignment for my B.sc at the Faculty of Engineering at Bar-Ilan University.
The app is implemented with geometry-processing-js and linear-algebra-js libraries provided by Rohan Sawhney and Keenan Crane.
The main deformation algorithm is based on papers:

- GPU-Accelerated Locally Injective Shape Deformation.
- A Subspace Method for Fast Locally Injective Harmonic Mapping.
- Piecewise linear mapping optimization based on the complex view.
